-- Particle System --
--- How the shader works ---
Every particle has an initial movement vector v0 and a spawnTime.
Particles are only drawn once their lifetime (totalTime - spawnTime) is non-negative.
Then their position is calculated via an equation of motion (x = v0 * lt + gravity * lt^2), which is added
onto the emitter position, from which all particles originate.
This results in the position where the vertex is drawn.
The color of the vertex is dependent on its lifetime and fades from bright yellow to dark red. After a certain
time is reached, the particles opacity reaches 0 and it is not visible anymore.
